Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
BootStrap
The reason I choose to use BootStrap because Bootstrap is built with a responsive grid system that allows website to automatically adjust its layout and size based on the screen width. This ensures that website looks good and functions well on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. See this page in action here
